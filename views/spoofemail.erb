This messages claims to be from <%=@from_email%>, but it is not!  This is an
example of just how simple it is to spoof an email address.  If an email from
this address had arrived in your inbox without warning, would you have trusted
that it came from the proper sender?  Would you still trust it after this?

This is why the Public PGP Signing service provides its service.  While anyone
can easily spoof the from address, it would be extremely difficult for someone
to fake a signature from a signed PGP key.  If you receive an email from an
address and it has been signed by a key corresponding to that address which has
been signed by our key, you can be reasonbly certain that it is a legitimate
email, and not a spoof like this.

While you need not sign every email you write, consider that email is not
particularly more secure than a standard letter, and the From address only
slightly more trustworthy than the return address on an envelope.  If you're
dealing with something important, such as business negotiations or communication
with your bank, it probably wouldn't hurt to sign your messages.  If you're
feeling brave, ask the person you're communicating with to send you their public
key and sign their messages.
